# ```mm2SANS```

Calculation of SANS scattering patterns from micromagnetic simulations.

In development, so please use with care, and let me know of obivous bugs.

## Installation

Easiest used is probably in conjuction with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which bundles python libraries for scientific computing, including Ipython/Jupyter notebooks.

To install the ```mm2SANS``` package, download the source code. Browse (within an Anaconda prompt) to the folder containing the unpacked code and run `python .\setup.py install`.

## Usage

See example IPython notebooks (*.ipynb*).

Each function in the code features a help text accessible via `command?` or via the `Shift-Tab` tool-tip shortcut from the IPython Notebook interface.
