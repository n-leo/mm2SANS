    "## Overview of three coordinate systems\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe a general SANS experiment, one needs to consider _three_ coordinate systems, as shown in the figure above. These coordinate systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The _beamline coordinates_, denoted with capital letters $U$, $V$, $W$. The (longitudinal) direction $U$ is parallel to the neutron beam ($\\vec{k}$) passing through the sample. The detector plane is aligned with the transverse directions $V$ (horizontal) and $W$ (vertical).\n",
    "- The sample is placed in a sample environment (e.g. a cryostat), which defines the _sample environment coordinates_, which are denoted with lower-case letters $u$, $v$, $w$. Within the code it is implicily assumed that the neutron polarisation is defined by a field set in the sample environment.\n",
    "- The _sample coordinates_ $x$, $y$, $z$ are used to specify positions $\\vec{R}_i$ and moments $\\vec{M}_i$ of the individual scatterers, e.g. which are the result of micromagnetic simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If no relative rotations between the (right-handed) coordiante systems are considered, the relative alignment of the principal axes is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $U \\parallel u \\parallel x$, parallel to beam direction\n",
    "- $V \\parallel v \\parallel y$, horizontal direction in detector plane\n",
    "- $W \\parallel w \\parallel z$, vertical direction in detector plane\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the micromagnetic simulations are done in a geometry that is largely aligned with the scattering geometry under investigation. For this it might be neccessary to swap axes, e.g. for a thin film, typically one chooses a $z^\\prime$ coordinate to be paralel to the surface normal, which would need to be swapped to the $x$ coordinate to be parallel to the beam direction."

The rotations are specified as a list of rotations around the principal axes of the sample, respectively the sample environment, which initially is collinear with the beamline coordinate system.\n",

    "Rotations are specified as a combination `[rotation_type, rotation_angle]`, where the first is a string which can be `\"roll\"`, `\"pitch\"` or `\"yaw\"`, and the latter is the rotation angle $\\phi$ in degrees. The types encode the following rotations:\n",

    "- `roll`: Rotation around axis parallel to the neutron beam $x$, respectively $u$. Positive angles $\\phi$ correspond to counter-clockwise rotations when viewed in the beam direction.\n",
    "- `pitch`: Rotation around the horizontal axis $y$, respectively $v$. Positive angles $\\phi$ tilt the sample/cryostat towards the detector.\n",

When an `mm2SANS.Experiment` object is initiated, thus the vector $\\vec{P}$ is transformed according to the rotations specified in `probe.Beamline.sample_environment_rotations`. If the neutron polarisation is set in the beamline coordinate system $U$, $V$, $W$, its value stored in the field `Experiment.Probe.Beamline.neutron_polarisation` needs to be reset explicitly."
